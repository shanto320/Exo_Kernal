What is an operating system that is truly for the developers and personal users? Well,the answer to this question is simple. At basic level it requires a kernel that is for the user, i.e. a kernel that gives user the maximum power. For personal computers, we do not require anything that can support more than 1 user. Imagine, you are a an user of the PC where it is important for you to have the complete control over your hardware and you do not wish to share any of your resources with anyone else. Be that you are a gamer or a programmer or any personal user. 
For this development, Initially we will focus on performance and security will be a feature that comes next. A performance based reliable robust kernel. 

In this system a USER and a Kernel would have the same privilages. All networking software, browser, tor, IP/sec, wireguard native driver support on vm.
